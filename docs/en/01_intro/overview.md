## 🚀 Core Capabilities

NekroAgent guides AI to generate accurate code and execute it in a sandbox through a powerful and flexible prompt construction system, interacting with the real environment via RPC communication. Key features include:

- Secure containerized **sandbox execution environment** with a complete Python runtime environment
- Powerful code **guidance, generation, error correction, and execution** capabilities, supporting complex tasks such as chart generation and general content processing
- Native multimodal **visual understanding and interaction** support, capable of processing images, files, and other resources
- Highly extensible **plugin system** providing various key node callbacks, prompt injection, and custom sandbox methods
- Native **multi-user scenario interaction** support, efficiently understanding group chat scenario requirements
- Cloud-based real-time resource sharing services, including plugins, personas, and other powerful and friendly **community-driven** capabilities
- Feature-rich **visual interface** application management panel
- Rejection of invalid prompts and abuse of iterative agents, achieving ultimate **cost reduction and efficiency improvement** for complex tasks
- **Event-driven** interaction architecture following an async-first efficient response mechanism
- Support for dynamic installation and **real-time introduction of PYPI dependencies**, unlocking the endless treasures of the Python universe
