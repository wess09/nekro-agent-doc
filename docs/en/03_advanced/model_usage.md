# Model Selection Guide

This document will help you understand the most suitable models to use in different scenarios in NekroAgent, and provide detailed performance, price, and applicability analysis. Currently, it mainly provides model selection information supplied by [NekroAgent Official Relay](https://api.nekro.ai), and will gradually add models from other sources.

#### Rating Description

In the recommended models, we use the following rating standards:

| Rating | Corresponding Level | Description |
| ---- | ------------------ | ---- |
| 👑   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Excellent |
| 🥇   | ⭐⭐⭐⭐   | Outstanding |
| 🥈   | ⭐⭐⭐     | Good |
| 🥉   | ⭐⭐       | Average |
| ⚪   | ⭐         | Poor |

::: warning Note
The following recommendations are for reference only. The same model from different sources may have differences in final performance due to channel conversion strategies, different configuration settings, concurrency situations, current status, etc. We encourage you to try multiple models based on actual usage, including those not in the following form, to choose the model that best suits you!

The models in the following tables are from [NekroAgent Official Relay - Available Model List](https://api.nekro.ai/panel/model_price). If you think there is a significant difference between the following tables and actual experience, you are welcome to contact us for feedback. We will continuously maintain and update the tables to better match actual experience

## NekroAgent Main Application

### Chat Conversation Process

The chat session process of NekroAgent (excluding plugin functions) is mainly affected by three configuration items: `Main Model Group (USE_MODEL_GROUP)`, `Debug/Agent Migration Model Group (DEBUG_MIGRATION_MODEL_GROUP)`, and `Fallback Model Group (FALLBACK_MODEL_GROUP)`. The specific scheduling strategy is as follows:

1. When a conversation process starts, the model in the `Main Model Group` is first used for generation
2. When the code generated by the `Main Model Group` triggers Agent type methods or produces program errors, subsequent calls in this process all use the model in the `Debug/Agent Migration Model Group` for iteration
3. If either the `Main Model Group` or `Debug/Agent Migration Model Group` model call fails, the model in the `Fallback Model Group` is used for generation
4. If the `Fallback Model Group` also fails to call, the response process ends in failure

Below is the list of recommended models for **Chat Conversation Process**:

Note:

- In NekroAgent, the `External Chain of Thought` switch of the model first used in the conversation process (usually the main model) will affect the use of chain of thought in subsequent calls of this conversation process. For example, if the main model enables `External Chain of Thought`, the iteration/debug model will also have the effect of `enabling external chain of thought`
- Generally, models that support `Built-in Thinking` are not recommended to enable `External Chain of Thought`, otherwise it may reduce model generation speed
- Due to the implementation of the prompt iteration mechanism, it is not recommended to mix models that `support vision` and `do not support vision`, otherwise it may lead to request format errors

### Plugin Development

The generation modification suggestion model in NekroAgent's **Plugin Editor** uses the `Plugin Code Generation Model Group (PLUGIN_GENERATE_MODEL_GROUP)` to generate code solutions for user needs. It is recommended to use models with strong coding capabilities and high quality. Below is the list of recommended models:

| Model Name                        | Quality | Speed | Stability | Cost-Effectiveness | Vision | Thinking | Notes |
| --------------------------------- | ------- | ----- | --------- | ------------------ | ------ | -------- | ----- |
| claude-4-5                        | 👑     | 🥈    | 🥈        | 🥈                 | 👁️    | 🧠       | Anthropic's latest high-quality flagship coding model |
| gemini-3-pro-preview              | 👑     | 🥉    | 🥈        | 🥉                 | 👁️    | 🧠       | Google's latest high-quality flagship model, excellent performance in the programming field, with powerful agent and coding capabilities ⚠️ Preview model |
| gemini-2.5-pro                    | 👑     | 🥇    | 🥇        | 🥈                 | 👁️    | 🧠       | Google's previous generation flagship model, excellent performance in the programming field, with adaptive thinking ability ⚠️ Expected to be discontinued as early as June 2026, recommend switching to `gemini-3-pro` |

After the generation model generates modification suggestions, we also need to use the `Plugin Code Application Model Group (PLUGIN_APPLY_MODEL_GROUP)` to apply the modification suggestions in the current plugin editor. It is recommended to use models with strong prompt compliance and fast generation speed. Below is the list of recommended models:

| Model Name         | Quality | Speed | Stability | Cost-Effectiveness | Vision | Thinking | Notes |
| ------------------ | ------- | ----- | --------- | ------------------ | ------ | -------- | ----- |
| gemini-2.5-flash   | 🥈     | 👑    | 🥇        | 🥈                 | 👁️    | ❌       | ⚠️ Expected to be discontinued as early as June 2026 |

## Built-in Plugins

### Emoticon Pack Plugin

The emoticon pack plugin needs to use a `Vector Embedding Model` to provide emoticon search capability. It is strongly recommended to use the `text-embedding-v3` model:

| Model Name                | Quality | Speed | Stability | Cost-Effectiveness | Vision | Dimensions | Notes |
| ----------------------- | ------- | ----- | --------- | ------------------ | ------ | ---------- | ----- |
| text-embedding-v3       | 👑     | 👑    | 👑        | 👑                 | ❌    | 1024       | Very cheap and efficient text embedding model provided by Alibaba Cloud |
| multimodal-embedding-v1 | 👑     | 🥇    | 👑        | 👑                 | ✅    | 1024       | Multimodal embedding model provided by Alibaba Cloud, but with many input restrictions, only recommended for special use |

### Drawing (Learn to Draw)

The drawing plugin supports OpenAI standard drawing API (such as DALL-E 3) and any OpenAI chat completion API that supports conversation-generated images. Below is the list of recommended models:

| Model Name                       | Quality | Speed | Stability | Cost-Effectiveness | Image-to-Image | Format         | Notes |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | ----- | --------- | ------------------ | -------------- | -------------- | ----- |
| gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview | 🥇     | 🥇    | 🥈        | 🥇                 | ✅             | Chat mode      | Gemini 2.5 drawing model ⚠️ Will be closed on January 15, 2026 |
| gemini-3-pro-image-preview     | 🥇     | 🥇    | 🥈        | 🥉                 | ✅             | Chat mode      | Gemini 3 drawing model, recommended to use with advanced drawing plugin (market) |
| sora_image                     | 👑     | ⚪    | 🥇        | 🥈                 | ✅             | Chat mode      | Consistent with ChatGPT official website 4o drawing, high compliance but very slow |
| Kolors                         | 🥈     | 👑    | 👑        | 🥇                 | ✅             | Image generation mode | Domestic drawing model, with single style and偏向 CG style |

## Notes

1. Model performance may change over time with updates
2. Price information is for reference only, actual prices are subject to official quotations
3. It is recommended to regularly evaluate model selection based on actual usage
4. **Experimental Models (exp/preview)**: These models are experimental and may be updated or closed at any time. It is recommended that:
   - Regularly follow [Google Gemini API Version Notes](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/changelog?hl=zh-cn) for the latest updates
   - Prepare backup solutions when using in production environments
   - Prioritize using stable version (GA) models
   - Some preview models will automatically redirect to stable versions. It is recommended to directly use stable version model names to avoid delays caused by redirection
5. **Model Redirection**: Some discontinued preview models will automatically redirect to corresponding stable versions, for example:
   - `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25` → `gemini-2.5-pro`
   - `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06` → `gemini-2.5-pro`
